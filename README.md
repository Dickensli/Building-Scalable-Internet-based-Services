# Large-scale Online Application Design (Python, Flask, JavaScript)}
1. Developed a large-scale web application (Javascript, Python, SQL) that provides an online album service.
2. Introduced basic uploading/deleting/searching functions as well as a recommendation system and an email digest system, with Angular as frontend framework and Flask as backend server. 
3. Applied Asynchronous Message Queues (Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis) techniques as well as load balancer (Nginx) to improve the scalability and efficiency.
4. Conducted performance test (Funkload) to understand the responsiveness of the system under certain conditions.
